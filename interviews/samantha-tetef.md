> Your name:
Samantha Tetef, but I also go by Sam!

> How long have you been programming?

I took my first computer science class in Fall of 2015, so almost a decade, but that has mostly been academic (I haven't had a SWE job yet).

> What's the most overused or overrated emoji?

:smile: (I don't know, I like them all, but the plain smile is a lil boring?)

> What do you wish was different about computers?

Infinite battery life, waterproof, doesn't hurt your eyeballs as much, all of them touchscreen

> Favorite website?

xkcd??

> Do you use a music streaming service?

Spotify!

> What is your favorite computer book (fiction or non-fiction)?

I haven't read this, but Grace Kwak (another W1) wrote a sci-fi book on AI, which is really cool, so I feel like that has to go here :eyes:

> How do you think AI will change computer programming?

I imagine AI will give people a little boost at the start of learning curves, especially for learning new languages, but it will still take strong fundamentals to maintain that momentum to get the rest of the way there.

> What was the first computer you loved.

I had a Lenovo Yoga that got me through most of college and grad school (the touchscreen was super helpful during covid because I could continue taking hand-written notes and write digital homework solutions).
