Zab is an RC'er and has been programming for 3 years.
How you wish computers could be different? Every once in a while we should just start from scratch. We've just kept adding on top of old things and we need to start with new ideas. Command line interfaces feel whack given where we are.
Fave website? The Internet archive
Fave computer book? "Nueromancer" by William Gibson
How does AI change programming? AI is going to do it all. We'll be in that solarpunk future we've all imagined. Everyone will be making things. Think about the jump from assembly to python. AI is that next thing. It's the next set of abstractions. Am I excited about AI? Yeah I am. But optimistic? TBD.
First computer you loved? On my first computer, the family computer, there was a cool gimmick where the icons were animated. The trash bin was like a dinosaur that threw things. It was a small detail but it made the computer come alive.
Overrated / overused Emoji? The Poop emoji. I don't get it but people love it.

Zab is a psuedonym. You might know them as someone who is superfically a pessimist but is, at their heart, an optimist.

> How do you think AI will change computer programming?

AI is going to do it all. We'll be in that solarpunk we've all imagined. Everyone will be making things and it'll make it so much more. Think about the jump from assembly to python. AI is that next thing. It's the next set of abstractions. Am I excited about AI? Yeah I am. But optimistic? TBD.

> What was the first computer you loved.

It was my family computer. On my first computer the cool gimmick was that the icons were animated. The trash bin was like a dinosaur that threw things. It was a small detail and it made the computer come alive. Watched a lot of startrek and wanted to see more than that.

I built a coputer in high school and I loved that.
