> Underrated Emoji

I don't know. I think emoji are appropriately rated. They're great. How about an underrated emoji. It's the dancing blob.
It's joy, enthusiasm, and general yay. **"The dancing blob captures the vibe we should all aspire to."**

> Something about RC most people don't know

There was an incident with a detective...

These are mostly rumors but... RC used to on a strange schedule so people could work part time (something like Monday Tuesday Friday). Also we used to operate out of somebody's office. Maybe it was Etsy?

There's also online resources that people in the batch probably don't know about- RCVerse (https://rcverse.recurse.com/) is a cool one.

> Fave spot to nearby

Dekalb market. It's an underground street market and there's a big variety. They capture the street market feeling instead of the mall cafeteria feeling.

> How did you come to RC?

I heard about RC from a friend who had come to RC when it was still called Hacker School. I applied and came to a batch and was looking for a job afterwards. I wanted to work somewhere with a culture like RC's and they were hiring so I work here now.


> Is it true this building is haunted?

I haven't heard that! I don't get the sense that it is but maybe you'd have to ask the church downstairs/.

> first Computer loved

My mom worked at a law office and they had word processors running word perfect and windows 3.1. I used to use them as a kid and they were magic.
