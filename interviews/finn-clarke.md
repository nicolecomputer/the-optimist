Finn Clarke is a staff member at RC and does not consider themselves a programmer.
Journey to RC? I was working at a law firm and thought maybe "law school" but I didn't like it. I heard about RC from an email and they didn't want a traditional cover letter. I loved that. I started here earlier this year.
Something about RC most people don't know? Our corporate name is "Five Blades Inc." which was based on an Onion article about how razor companies kept adding more blades. Now five five-blade razors are common.
Fave spot nearby? Bahn migos! I get the vegetarian Bahn Mi and a bubble tea. Also a shoutout to the falafel cart on Court Street.
The Hub is haunted? You know I do sometimes hear the clickety-clack of keys late at night but when I go look there's no one programming. I think it's a nerd's ghost though so I'm not scared.
First computer loved? My aunt gave me a plasticky green clamshell Mac laptop. It barely worked and I loved it.
Overrated / overused Emoji? The cool glasses emoji- I use it too much.

> How did you come to RC?

I was working at a law firm and thought maybe "law school" but didn't like it. I heard about RC on an email and they didn't want a traditional cover letter. I liked that. I started earlier this year in April.

> Is it true the RC office is haunted?

You know I do sometimes hear the clickity clack of keys late at night but when I go look there's no one programming. I think its a nerd's ghost though so I'm not scared of it.

> First computer ever loved

My aunt gave me a plasticky clamshell mac laptop that was green. It barely worked and I loved it.
