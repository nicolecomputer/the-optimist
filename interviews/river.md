How could computers be different? I wish that I could write a program that graphics and sounds without having to be an expert in complicated libraries. I also wish there was a well-defined instruction set for graphics cards but there are economic reasons that there isn't. But, one of the deepest things for me is that I wish it were easier to share code between languages. It works if the "other language" is C but if I write F* and you write Ruby it's really hard to make the code interoperate. It means that starting a new programming language isn't just a technical challenge, it's a marketing one.

How does AI change programming? I'm not particularly educated on that issue but I think there will probably be more programmers in the future.
First computer loved? In middle school my parents got me an ugly beige computer, it probably ran something after Windows 95.

> How long have you been programming?

17 years

> What's the most overused or overrated emoji?

Thinking face - can convey mild dergatory vibe

> What do you wish was different about computers?

I wish that I could write a program that draws graphics and makes sounds and is cross platform without having to be an expert in many many codebases that are impossible to understand.

I wish there was a weel defined instruction set for graphics cards. I think there's economic reasons it's not the case.

I wisht aht consumer consumer OSes were open source.

I wish programming languages let you use code from other languages. It's frustrating that when I'm writing in ruby and you're writing in F* it's hard to use code from each other. It means making new languages means you no tonly have to make a new compiler but you have to do a marketting campaign because you need to convince people to make libraries.

> Favorite website?

Doorbot- lets me call the elevator

> Do you use a music streaming service?

No streaming service. I'm a FLAC collector

> What is your favorite computer book (fiction or non-fiction)?

practical foundations of programming languages by Bob Harper

> How do you think AI will change computer programming?

Not particularly educated but there will probably be more programmers.

> What was the first computer you loved.

The first PC my parents got me in middle school and it had some kind of microsfot basic installed. It was after windows 95. Ugly biege computer.
