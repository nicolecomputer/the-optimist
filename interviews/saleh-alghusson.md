How could computers be different? I wish they were easier to use. Computers [and software] are built by computer people and for computer people. For example, I have a neighbor who I help. I noticed that a browser is hard for her. Every website has a different layout and works differently. When she needed to log in she opened a Word document because, for her, the accessibility of being able to find her password is more important the security. Adding a password manager would have meant adding more complexity.
Fave website? Neal.fun
Fave computer book? "The Art of Computer Programming" by Donald Knuth. It made me love programming.
How does AI change programming? I think developing software is going to get a lot easier. I also noticed that lots of software isn't designed for AI. I was signing up for x.com recently and it took me 10 minutes to figure out the captcha- they're getting too hard because they're designed to defend against AI. I think in the future we're going to have a lot fewer programmers and I'm not optimistic about it because AI abstracts out all of the steps of writing a program.
First computer loved? I switched from a Windows computer to a Macbook Air and I was amazed at how pleasant it was to use. It changed how I thought about what computers could be.
Overrated / overused Emoji? The water splash one- what does it mean?

I wish they were easier to use. **Computers [and software] are built by computer people and for computer people**. For example I have a neighbor who I help sometimes. I notice that a browser is hard for- every website has a different layout and works differently. When she needed to log in she opened a word document because, for her, the accessibility is more important the security. Adding a password manager would have been adding more complexity.

I think developping software is going to get a lot easier. I also notice that lots of software isn't designed for AI. I was signing up for x.com recently and it took me 10 minutes to figure out the captcha- they're getting too hard as they design to defend against AI. I think in the future we're going to have a lot less programmers and I'm not optimistic about it. AI abstracts out all of the steps of writing a program.

> First Computer I loved

I switched from a Windows computer to a Macbook Air and I was amazed at how pleasant it was to use. It really changed how I thought about what computers could be.
