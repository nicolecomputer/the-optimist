Nick Bergson-Shilcock is a staff member at RC and has been programming for 30 years (the Apple II on the fourth floor was his computer).
Journey to RC? The super quick version. I always wanted to start company. I met Dave and Sonali and we decided to start something. For a while we solved problems that weren't really problems and then we stumbled upon the idea for Hacker School which became The Recurse Center.
Something about RC most people don't know? Daniel Ek, the CEO of Spotify, visited during our second batch. He wasn't so well known at the time. He told us that the space we were working in had previously been a recording studio where Bob Markley had recorded.
Fave spot nearby? Sweet green or Naya are gotos but my favorite spot is Sanpanino, an amazing sandwhich spot.
First computer loved? A mac plus. It had MacPaint on it which was mind-blowing at the time.
The Hub is haunted? No. Definitely not. Ghosts don't exist.
Overrated / overused Emoji? Confetti. It's used so much and it's not that celebratory.
