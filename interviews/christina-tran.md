> Overused / overrated emoji

The crying face one. It's used in so many contexts. People use it when something is funny, sad, or when they're happy.

> How do I wish computers could be different.

I wish windows on the Desktop wasn't so overwhelming. I'm also realizing that maybe we don't need GUIs for everything as I work through "The Missing Semester". I'm so impressed when someone opens a terminal to do calculations rather than going to the calculator app.

> Favorite website

neal.fun and neocities

> Steaming service

Spotify - I'm on a family plan

> Favorite Computer Book

**When I'm not at the computer I don't still want to think about computers** but recently I've been loving "The Nature of Code"

> AI

I think AI is going to separate people who really like programming from people who see it as a means to an end. The technology itself is really cool but right not companies are deciding how AI gets used. I'm not optimistic about it. I think we're going to see a change is what a programmer is. There will be more people programming but it will be a different kind of programming.

> First computer I loved

My family had a dinosaur that a sticker with three birds on it. It wasn't my computer but I would sneak into the room it was in and run emulators on it. It ran Windows.
