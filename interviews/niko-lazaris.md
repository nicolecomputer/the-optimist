Slowly programming is going to become more creator-directed and more high level. We're in an AI hype bubble right now. I think AI is going to lower the barrier to creating things- for example I had a neighbor who was able to make a game and when I talked to them I was excited to talk about data structures and how they might store the data. It turns out they are using a LLM and the data structures didn't matter. Still **I think the more people building things, the better.**
