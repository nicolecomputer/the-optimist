How could computers be different? I wish there were less screens. We need more buttons. It sucks that everything is just a black rectangle.
Fave website? The Internet Archive
Fave computer book? "Coders at work" by Peter Seibel
How does AI change programming? Slowly programming is going to become more creator-directed and high level. We're in an AI hype bubble right now. I think AI is going to lower the barrier to creating things- for example I had a neighbor who was able to make a game and when I talked to them I was excited to talk about data structures. I was asked them how the data was being stored and accessed and it turns out they are using a LLM. The data structures didn't matter. Still, I think the more people building things, the better.
First computer loved? I can't exactly remember but I know that it was running Windows 95.
Overrated / overused Emoji? The face ones. We can do better in 2024.
