Cowboy hat

> What do you wish was different about computers?

Wish it were easier to dig into iPad work. A lot of computers in the 80s and 90s (including macs!) that could change the way the computer worked. We've lost that ability with closed tablets and something was lost in that change.

> How do you think AI will change computer programming?

It'll make it harder to do code reviews and reason about how code works. The next paradism after LLMs will have a lot of potential but it's more than 10 years out. Remember that accountants had a strong reaction to spreadsheets came out. Is optimistic with the future with AI.

Predicting more than 10 years is like trying to preduct tha tinfluences would exit in 2000.

IBM AT that Dad bought at a computer fair.
