Michael Chung is an RC'er and has been programming for 14 years.
How could computers be different? I think spatially with computers- I have a desktop just for personal things, another for work things, and another for church things. When I plug into an external monitor my windows get all mixed up. I know there are ways to fix this but more generally I think in categories and I wish my computer was better at maintaining that state. I need compartmentalization.
Fave website? Functionally it's Notion. I planned my wedding with it.
Fave computer book? I'm enjoying "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" by  Martin Kleppmann
How does AI change programming? So far we've seen it take on the job of writing boilerplate job. I've heard from other programmers that it's making the task of understanding large codebases easier. I feel optimistic about AI in programming but I feel less optimistic about it in other domains and fields. I think in the future more people will be able to use programming.
First computer loved? Gameboy Color playing Pokemon Gold. It was my first experience with a computer that was personal and mine.
Overrated / overused Emoji? I hate the tongue-sticking-out emoji. Facebook used to have a different emoji set and it had bigger eyes and was a little sad. The current one is too silly. I use the upside-down emoji now to give the same feeling.

> How long have you been programming?

High school, then didn't touch it again until college. 14 years

> What's the most overused or overrated emoji?

Hate the colon p eomji (the tongue one) started using in facebook days and the face looked a little dejected and sad and had bigger eyes. But now its too silly. The upside down feeling gives the same feeling.

> What do you wish was different about computers?

I iwsh there was an easier way to. Wish computers would maintain the way tha tI setup my fdektops and then remember when a monitor is plugged in. I thin in categories and use desktops very intentionally. I use personal things and then code stuff and other things. I need compartientlaisation. Better respect boxe and categories.

> Favorite website?

functionally, Notion. I planned my wedding on notion. Notion is wonderful.

> Do you use a music streaming service?
Spotify - but mostly for podcasts. I used to listen a ton of calssical music and listened to a TON TON of classical music. I was listening critically. I'm bad at listeningin passively because I think k about it critically.

I describe myself as a depth first search but it takes me a very long time to branch out.

> What is your favorite computer book (fiction or non-fiction)?


I'm really enjoying "Designing data intesneive languages"


> How do you think AI will change computer programming?

I feel like the. It feels like what we've seen so far adn where I think it'll slot in is taking the place of the boilerplate stuff. It'll make it easier to get started. It'll make it very useful to understand a whole codebase. It's useful for having the full knowledge of the codebase and search within. It'll make the annoying parts les annoying.  I feel very optimistic about AI in programming. I feel less optimistic about it in other places. I think that there will be more programmers in the future because I think more people will be able to use programming.

> What was the first computer you loved.

Gameboy color specifically playing pokemon gold. It was my first personal experience with with computers.
