On November 19th Recurse opened its doors to alumni, friends, and curious programmers from across New York for a localhost and a talk by Greg Sadetsky. The topic of the evening was Greg's recent project, Disco, and more broadly his love of websites and the open web. "Little websites, nothing bothering anybody, just existing. It's so beautiful" he waxed at the beginning of his talk. Greg's engaging speaking style had the audience rapt when he came to his pitch "If I'm pitching you anything it's this. You can put up a website on Disco. You can have a domain and everything, it's really cool." Curious RC'ers should check out the GitHub org letsdiscodev for more information.

"If I'm pitching you one thing its this- you can put your website on it. You can have a domain and eerything. It's kind of cool.... Don't use it for AI but for anything of lesser importance maybe it's good."

"We came from heroku, we're heroku people. We don't used it anymore. It doens't have that same shine but we miss it. We liked it"
