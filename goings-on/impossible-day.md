# Impossible Day

"...If everyone's trying to do a very difficult thing together and overshoots their limits, it becomes less of a tribulation and more fun," says RC's Rachel Vincent Petacat who has been at RC for over a decade. Impossible Day is a relatively recent RC tradition- It began in January 2023 and has run every 6 weeks since, meaning RC'ers doing a full batch will get two chances to participate. The tradition began as a way for folks to work on building the volitional muscles and over its relatively recent history it's already produced beloved projects including a Bluetooth mesh network (Robin Neufeld and Amanda Galemmo), a game where piano notes are heard in loudness relative to their distance (Ryan Goldstein) and controller for a trombone game using an otamatone (Christina Tran). Impossible Day ran on November 19th, 2024, and will be back again in early 2025.
