# Wrong Answers Only Day

Ever experience writer's block or get suck in a loop of trying for perfection? Miriam Budayr, a current RC'er has. "As a classically trained musician, I find that sometimes focus on perfect so I try to do the exact opposite of making something perfect. I try to make it cringe, which makes me laugh and that makes me creative". Wrong Answers Only Day was a workshop held on November 15th. Around 20 people participated and created things in the wrong way to highlight mistakes. Some notable examples included resumes of just failures and drawing iconic Disney princesses from memory. "Creativity is hard and showing up is hard, I hope this made it easier," says Miriam. When asked about doing it again Miriam felt optimistic. "I would love to see it happen again or have someone in Winter 2 take it on."

Wrong answers only at 11! @Miriam Budayr (she) (F2'24) and I invite you to join us for an hour to experiment with what it means to make art, music, and program -- incorrectly, or poorly!

We'll be in one of the two meeting rooms on the first floor, and in Genera for remote folks

Rough Agenda:
11 - Miriam and I introduce WaoaW
11:15 - we brainstorm mediums of creation and how to mess them up
11:30 - coasting off of that, we make some stuff! Or dig up things we want to share
12:15 - we regroup to present
