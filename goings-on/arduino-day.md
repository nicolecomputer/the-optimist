On November 8th, a group of around twenty gathered to explore physical making, electronics, and the Arduino for Arduino Day. Most had only a little familiarity with the tools but came curious and ready to learn. One attendee, Justin T Schulz, went from not having worked with electronics before to being able to have a working metronome (a project he hopes to continue to work on). When asked about the importance of making things one of the day's organizers, Shenai Chen, said "Making something that you really really want to see in the world affirms that you are giving yourself permission to listen to yourself [... and] affirms that your needs are important. [It's also important] that you don't have to contort yourself to the shape of [proprietary os's] and yourself practice following through on a promise to yourself. [...] The more things you make, the more you understand who you are by seeing the finished artifact out there in the world!". A group of makers continue to experiment with making physical things so be on the lookout during your time at RC!
