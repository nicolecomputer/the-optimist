# From the editor

Welcome to "The Optimist". We're living through a time of change- AI is becoming a part of the everyday workload and is changing how we interact with computers, new languages are becoming popular, and web development seems to be in a constant state of reinventing itself. And yet, in all of that, there is a human spark that shines and endures. The Optimist is a snapshot of a moment in time, the start of Winter 2024.

In this newszine, you'll find interviews with some of the minds at work at The Recurse Center, news on happenings, illustrations, puzzles, and silly things. I hope that you'll pop your phone on its charger, pour yourself a coffee or tea, and settle in.

Be good to one another,

Nicole Watts
