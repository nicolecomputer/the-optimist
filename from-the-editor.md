# From the editor

Welcome to "The Optimist". We're living through a time of profound technological transformationâ€”AI is becoming an important part of our everyday workload, and changing how we interact with computers- sometimes in surprising ways. New programming languages are emerging and gaining traction, while web development seems to be in a constant state of reinvention. And yet, in all of this change, there is a distinctly human spark that shines and endures: our creativity, our curiosity, and our empathy for one another. We continue to find joy in the human act of making.

The Optimist is a snapshot of a moment in time, the start of Winter 2024 at the Recurse Center. We're celebrating the dreams in the algorithms and the people who make the machines run. Ahead, you'll find interviews with some of the minds at work here at The Recurse Center, news on happenings, illustrations, puzzles, and silly things. I hope that you'll pop your phone on its charger, take a break, pour yourself a coffee or tea, and settle in.

Be good to one another,

Nicole Watts
